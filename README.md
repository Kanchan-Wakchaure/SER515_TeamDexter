Design Architecture:
- We will be implementing Movie Showtime Finder web application using MEAN stack which
  uses Model-View-Controller architecture.
- MEAN stands for: 
  M = MongoDB 
  E = Express.js
  A = Angular.js
  N = Node.js
- Model is implemented using MongoDB, View with Angular and Controller with Node.js/Express.js APIs.
- Reference for MEAN architecture:
